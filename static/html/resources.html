            <p>
              Here is a list of resources for further reading and study. There are many more out there in the wild, and probably the best thing to do is explore several of them until you find one that really begins to click for you. I hope that my own explanations are helpful and truly engage your interest!
              Nevertheless, we each learn in different ways, so if this site's presentation of the subject matter isn't the best for you, there are many others! This site constitutes a first effort to articulate these concepts and to teach myself. I'm learning too, and feedback is welcome.

            <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms">Grokking Algorithms (book)</a>
            <p>
              A fantastic introduction that's great for us visual learners, with many visualizations drawn by the author. I'm currently reading this. It manages to be easy to digest while simultaneously presenting hard topics very clearly.
            </p>

            <a href="https://leanpub.com/computer-science-distilled">Computer Science Distilled (book)</a>
            <p>
              I definitely think this book is worth reading. At the time of this writing I'm in Chapter 3 and I'm find it very helpful. It bypasses academic formalities and gets to the roots quickly. This book is about more than just algorithms, it aims to teach problem solving generally.

            <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms">Introductory Computer Science Algorithms, by Khan Academy (subject unit)</a>
            <p>
              The venerable Khan Academy has put together an algorithms unit in partnership with Dartmouth computer science professors. This material is being updated every few months. I've used this a little but plan to go through it in detail eventually as a review. I'm glad they're still adding to it, as some important specifics are not made explicit (yet). Nevertheless it's an extremely helpful resource.

            <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/comp-number-theory/v/algorithmic-efficiency">"Algorithmic Efficiency" by Khan Academy (video)</a>
            <p>
              So why is efficiency important? How about when you're writing procedures that do fundamental calculations for a Mars rover? While this particular video drops you into the middle of "Journey Into Cryptography", you can ignore the parts that don't make sense yet and see some really cool visualizations starting at about 5:30 that might just give you the intuitive starting point you're looking for.

            <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11">Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python - MITx</a> (<a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a>)
            <p>
              If you're going to take a full beginner's computer science course, I suggest either this one or CS50 (below). They both are high quality courses, each with it's own approach. Check them both out, it's likely you'll prefer one or the other. There is also an <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/">OpenCourseWare</a> site and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytpJdnlu9ug&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63WbdFxL8giv4yhgdMGaZNA">YouTube playlist</a> (although it appears to be classroom lectures rather than the lectures designed specifically for the online edX course). I found myself supplementing this course's material with CS50's excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/cs50tv">YouTube Channel</a>. This MIT course introduces you to Python, which is a fun (and powerful) language to start learning with, and also has a massive community and user base.

            <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">Introduction to Computer Science - CS50x</a> (<a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX</a>)
            <p>
              Another excellent introductory course: "teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently." The languages used include C, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and SQL database query language. The same caveat applies as with the MITx course above: check out both of them and maybe even use both of them to learn the fundamentals. I took the MITx course and supplemented with CS50's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/cs50tv">YouTube Channel</a>. I still would like to take this course from beginning to end, I think it's that valuable.

            <p>
              A careful and helpful explanation by a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/707111/ryan">top contributor</a> to Stack Overflow. If you scroll down further you'll find an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/6620071/5797160"> extremely detailed answer</a>, perhaps clearer for mathematically minded people, that discusses visualizing orders of growth and average case, among other topics. It's pretty fascinating to work through.
