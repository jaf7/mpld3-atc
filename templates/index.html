                Hello and welcome! This site is my first web development project and it functions as a kind of learning platform. After some uncertainty about how to make a start at actually <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">building</em> something, I decided to just let my interest guide me. For me this meant I wanted to review the fundamentals of algorithm <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">time complexity</em>. Since this subject matter lends itself to visualization (by plotting rates of change on a graph), I decided to attempt to present a few interactive plots, with accompanying brief discussion of what I'm learning about algorithms. As such, the effort to articulate these concepts clearly is an ongoing project in itself. I'm eager to build my understanding so feedback is welcome (contact info is in the footer).
                </p>

                <p>
                You can read a detailed <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='html/overview.html') }}">overview</a> of my motivation and progress in building this site. I'm also compiling a list of helpful <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='html/resources.html') }}">resources</a> for beginning / further study. You'll find the GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/jaf7/mpld3-growth-complexity-demo">here</a> (the README contains additional info and my current TODO / FIXME list). This site's styling is inspired by the strikingly cool <a class="musicforprogramming" href="https://musicforprogramming.net/">Music For Programming</a> site by <a class="musicforprogramming" href="http://johndatadavies.info/">John Davies</a>. This is an ongoing learning experience, and it's perhaps as valuable for uncovering how <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">not</em> to do some things as for learning appropriate practices. I currently think that on balance, as a beginner, it's good to have a project where you can play around and throw things at the wall. It provides numerous opportunities for mistakes, backtracking, changing, and refining as you learn. And it's serious fun!

                <div class="subhead">// What is an Algorithm?</div>
                <p>
                There's an interesting fact about problem solving: we tend not to solve the same problem over and over again. That is, we don't reformulate a solution to a problem every time we're confronted with it. A problem solution by its nature is something we can re-use. Of course we often refine solutions, or alter them to fit a particular case just so. But the structure--the pattern of a formulated solution--tends to remain stable in a significant way. Otherwise I'd offer that it's a different, alternative solution. And indeed, discerning the most appropriate solution to apply, out of the alternatives we can formulate, is a crucial skill in problem solving. With long and intentional practice, we can become amazingly adept at this skill of discerning application.
                </p>

                <p>
                An algorithm is an explicit way of expressing a solution by recasting it into a series of ordered, unambiguous steps that, given an input, produce a result. In a general sense, a <a href="https://iambaker.net/the-perfect-chocolate-cake/">recipe</a> for chocolate cake, or <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/EENUAFtoGqJ2">directions</a> to a museum in the city, or the <a href="http://www.thisoldtractor.com/projects_roy_smith_2013-03-19_inspect_and_prepare_the_crankcase.html">steps</a> to rebuild a motorcycle engine are all algorithms. And so are the steps in code that effect the ordering of a list, and the steps in code that effect a search for an item in that list.
                </p>

                <p>
                Problems we encounter as developers can be highly complex. When we think of complexity, we intuitively relate this to the difficulty in solving a problem. Baking a cake might be less difficult, less complex, than rebuilding a motorcycle engine (perhaps depending on who's doing the work). In the face of complexity we're obliged to decompose problems into simpler sub-problems. As we do the work of decomposition, we can reach a point where we've articulated discrete units of work, (operations or steps) to be performed. In computation, when these steps lead from an input to a solution output, we've formulated an algorithm. And we are able to generalize this series of steps to apply to many variations of the original problem. But there are almost always multiple approaches to solving a problem. How do we decide what the most effective solution is?
                </p>
                <p>
                Note: For the sake of simplicity and to facilitate grasping the fundamental concepts, here we'll consider solutions only in terms of execution time or <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">running time</em>, which in computer science is referred to as <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">time complexity</em>. "Space complexity" (having to do with <a href="http://btechsmartclass.com/DS/U1_T3.html" target="_blank"> memory requirements</a>), though it may be a less frequent consideration, is also important to understand. It is typically presented after learning time complexity.
                </p>

                <hr class="style_1">

                <div class="subhead">// What is Time Complexity?</div>
                <p>
                Time complexity refers to how the running time of an algorithm grows as its input scales. It's a tool for analyzing how efficiently one class of algorithms will compute a solution, relative to other kinds of algorithms, and independent of their operating environment (how fast the processor is, or how the programming language is implemented, for example). This independence results in part from the fact that when analyzing time complexity, we consider not elapsed clock time, but instead the <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">number of operations performed</em> to reach a solution.<a class="footnote" id="footnote-1-ref" href="#footnote-1" aria-label="See footnote">[1]</a> (We'll examine another kind of "independence" momentarily). When we ask what the time complexity of an algorithm is, we are asking (in part) about the <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">rate of growth</em> of this number, as our input size increases. That is, how quickly does the number of operations performed increase as the size of the input increases? This rate of growth gives us something concrete to compare to other algorithm growth rates. And we do this comparison to understand the relative resource consumption of different kinds of algorithmic solutions. We are asking "what is the computational cost of this solution?" and we're producing a concrete, quantified answer.
                </p>
                <p class="footnote-ref" id="footnote-1">[1] In order to best lay a foundational understanding, we hold the time value of an "operation" constant here. That is, we assume that the amount of time it takes to perform any discrete operation is identical. <a href="#footnote-1-ref" aria-label="Return to text">&#8617;</a></p>

                <hr class="style_1">

                <div class="subhead">// What is Big O Notation?</div>
                <p class="waypoint" id="what-is-big-o">
                To return briefly to the notion of <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">independence</em>: while a certain kind of independence (from a particular operating environment) can be achieved by considering the number of operations performed by the algorithm (instead of elapsed compute time), what about the <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">input value</em> itself? Doesn't the efficiency of an algorithm still depend on the particular input value(s) provided? Let's illustrate this. Let's say we have an array (or list) of unique non-repeating values that we want to search for the index of a particular element. (Data structures such as this array are often referred to as the <a href="https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Search_space" target="_blank">search space</a>). We'll search this search space using an algorithm (the function <span class="microlight">iterateArray()</span>) to iterate over <span class="microlight">inputArray</span>, checking for equivalence to our element, returning the element location if the value is present in the array or false otherwise:
                </p>
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1">
                    <div class="microlight" contenteditable="true">function iterateArray( inputArray, element ) {
  for ( let i = 0; i < inputArray.length; i++ ) {
    if ( inputArray[i] === element ) {
      return 'element ' + element
             +  ' is at index ' + i;
    }
  }
  return 'element ' + element
         + ' is not contained in the input array';
}
                    </div>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                  <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">(All code blocks are editable by clicking inside them, so feel free to play around with them, or copy them to a <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/" target="_blank">DevTools Console</a> or <a href="https://repl.it/" target="_blank">repl.it</a> to experiment)</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                Now let's say that our input array is a sorted list of integers from 1 to 100: <span class="microlight">[1,2,3,4,5,6, ...100]</span>. How many operations will it take to return a match? The answer is <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">dependent</em> on both the size of our input array and the element we're searching for: if <span class="microlight">element = 5</span>, <span class="microlight">iterateArray()</span> will perform 5 comparisons (while evaluating the <span class="microlight">if</span> statement) to match the integer 5. But if <span class="microlight">element = 50</span>, the number of comparison operations increases by 45. As our list size grows, the potential cost in operations required to match an element in it grows. If our array contains <span class="microlight">4,000,000,000</span> elements, this algorithm will match the element at <span class="microlight">index 5</span> in many fewer operations than it will take to match the element at <span class="microlight">index 999,999,999</span>. It's apparent that as our input array size grows arbitrarily large, the speed of this algorithm can vary a great deal. But it would be nearly impossible to reliably compare this algorithm type to other types if it remains subject to such variation. How do we establish a reliable representation of this algorithm's efficiency that is not affected by input variability?
                </p>
                <p>
                It turns out that the answer lies in the phenomenon we've just witnessed: the input size <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">as it grows arbitrarily large</em>. That is, we can consider such algorithms strictly in a <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">worst case</em> scenario. This worst case is also referred to as an <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">upper bound</em>: meaning we can impose a constraint on our input, one that always represents this input as the <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">most costly</em> to obtain an output solution from. For every algorithm pattern we analyze, we assume this worst case. In this way, the effect of the variability we observe above becomes insignificant (its impact on algorithm performance becomes vanishingly small). So we are examining the performance of our algorithm as we approach an upper bound in computation cost (such as an arbitrarily large input array size). In turn, we can impose the same <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">upper bound input size</em> constraint on a second algorithm that we're comparing. As a result, this comparison is effectively independent of any particular input size (Also very important to understand are "average case" and "best case" complexities, but these are apparently best studied after gaining a grasp of worst case complexity--you can find explanations of these in some of the <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='html/resources.html') }}">resources</a> I've listed).
                </p>
                <p>
                With this approach we can make two useful examinations: first, how an algorithm type's efficiency changes as its input size grows, and second, how the efficiency of one algorithm type compares to the efficiency of another algorithm type. Take our example code above. In the first examination, we observe what happens as the size of our input array grows arbitrarily large. At what <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">rate</em> will our number of operations grow? In the latter examination, we can compare the relative growth rates of two different types of algorithm (such as the one we've expressed above compared to a second, different pattern). But how do we describe these <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">growth rates</em>? We express them as discrete <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">Orders of Growth</em>: with <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">Big O</em> notation (literally using a capital "O"). Orders of Growth, or complexity, are notated as in these examples (this is not an exhaustive list): <span class="solarized_base1_lightened">`O(n)` (linear), `O(log(n))` (logarithmic), `O(nlog(n))` (linear-log), `O(n^2)` (quadratic), `O(2^n)` (exponential)</span>.

If you generate an array of 100 elements, the initial search space will contain all values from index 0 to index 99 (<span class="microlight">array.length - 1</span>). As a first guess, the algorithm chooses the element at the midpoint index of the array. Then it checks if this element is greater or less than the target element (passed into the function as the second argument). If it's greater, the low index is redefined to be 1 greater than the current midpoint index. This effectively discards the lower half of our search space, since the target element cannot be contained in that portion of the array. If the guessed element is less than target element, the high index is redefined instead, discarding the upper half of the search space. A new midpoint is calculated, and the process repeats until the guessed element equals the target element.

                Here's where it really gets interesting! The number of operations this algorithm must perform to return an answer (in the worst case) is expressed as `O(log n)`. This means the time complexity (growth rate) of binary search is <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">logarithmic time</em> (when analyzing running times, we can assume that `log n` implies base 2: `log_2 n`).
                </p>

                <p>
                (<em class="solarized_base1_lightened">Want to review logarithms? Here's a nice <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/exponential-and-logarithmic-functions/introduction-to-logarithms/v/logarithms" target="_blank">intro</a>, and here's an extensive set of <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/exponential-and-logarithmic-functions" target="_blank">lessons</a></em>).
                </p>

                <p>
                For any input size <span class="microlight">n</span>, the number of operations performed (<em class="solarized_base1_lightened">running time</em>) by binary search will be equivalent to `log_2 n`. So if our input array size is 4,000,000,000 elements, then in the worst case <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">binary search</em> will locate the target element in only `log_2 (4,000,000,000) = 32` operations, while <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">linear search</em> will run through 4,000,000,000 comparisons! Take another look at the plot comparing these two algorithm growth rates. It's immediately evident that as our input size grows, an algorithm like binary search with a time complexity of <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">"Order log n"</em> or "log time" will drastically outperform an <em class="solarized_base1_lightened">"Order n"</em> or "linear time" algorithm like linear search.
